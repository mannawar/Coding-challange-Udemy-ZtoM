// JavaScript is a single threaded language that can be non-blocking
//chrome has v8 javaScript engine. it has two parts viz. memory heap and call stack
//memory leak- unused memory
const a = 1;
const b = 10;
const c = 100;
//Global variables are bad because they remain in memory even if they aren't used

//call stack(synchronous task- line-10 will get exceuted first, then line-11 and then line-12)

//call stack is first-in-last-out
//Issues with multithreaded language is they have deadlocks
